Alright! Imagine you have two LEGO boxes:

One box has people's names and their favorite toy ID

The other box has toy IDs and the toy names


Box 1: People

Person	Toy ID

Alice	1
Bob	2
Carol	3


Box 2: Toys

Toy ID	Toy Name

1	Teddy Bear
2	Toy Car
4	Robot


Now you want to know which toy each person likes, using the toy ID to match both boxes. That’s what a JOIN does!

Types of JOINS (like ways of playing):

1. INNER JOIN:

Only show people who have a matching toy.

Result: | Person | Toy Name   | |--------|------------| | Alice  | Teddy Bear | | Bob    | Toy Car    |

Carol liked toy ID 3, but that toy wasn’t found in the toy box — so she is not shown.


---

2. LEFT JOIN:

Show everyone from the people box, even if their toy is missing.

Result: | Person | Toy Name   | |--------|------------| | Alice  | Teddy Bear | | Bob    | Toy Car    | | Carol  | NULL       | ← No toy found


---

3. RIGHT JOIN:

Show all toys, even if no person likes them.

Result: | Person | Toy Name   | |--------|------------| | Alice  | Teddy Bear | | Bob    | Toy Car    | | NULL   | Robot      | ← No one likes this toy


---

So, think of JOINs like connecting boxes using toy IDs — to build a big new box with all the info you want!
