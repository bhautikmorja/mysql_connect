Perfect! You want to use multiple tables without JOIN, but still use AS — here's how that works.


---

1. Select from multiple tables (not recommended in real use, but possible)

SELECT 
  p.name AS person_name,
  t.toy_name AS toy_name
FROM people AS p, toys AS t;

This is called a Cartesian product — it combines every row in people with every row in toys, like multiplying them together.

If people has 3 rows and toys has 2 rows, the result will have 3 × 2 = 6 rows.


---

Example:

people table:

id	name	toy_id

1	Alice	1
2	Bob	2


toys table:

id	toy_name

1	Teddy Bear
2	Toy Car


Query:

SELECT 
  p.name AS person_name, 
  t.toy_name AS toy
FROM people AS p, toys AS t;

Result: | person_name | toy       | |-------------|-----------| | Alice       | Teddy Bear| | Alice       | Toy Car   | | Bob         | Teddy Bear| | Bob         | Toy Car   |

When to use this:

Only when you really want all combinations (rare). Usually, JOIN is better to match rows properly.

Let me know if you want to filter them or add conditions!
